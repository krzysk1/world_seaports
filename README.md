# world_seaports
 World generic seaplane bases for Aerofly FS2 (scenery)

 In fact, the seaplanes are not supported by AeroflyFS2 yet but the data can be used for future enhancements.
 
	584 seaports created
	8 beacon lights created
	133 control towers created	

 To instal just unzip all or selected airport files/countries into '\Documents\Aerofly FS 2\scenery\places\' folder.
 

 It's not a complete scenery! For full effect you should add photoscenery, cultivation, and elevation mesh for selected regions on your own. To increase performance it is recommended to remove duplicated arports and not used countries.
 
 
 Some features may not work as intended and this scenery could crash your Aerofly FS2. 
 Use it at your own risk!
